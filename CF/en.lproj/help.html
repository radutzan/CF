            <dt>The estimations are wrong / There's no information for my stop or service</dt>
            <dd>Sorry to hear that. We recommend <a href="http://twitter.com/transantiago">tweeting @transantiago</a> to let them know you're having problems with their data. You can find out more about who's responsible for delivering the stop estimations in the About screen.</dd>
            
            <dt>Where's the stop code?</dt>
            <dd>The stop code should be on the lower right hand side of the stop sign. If you can't find it or if it isn't there, you can use the Stops Map to find your stop. You can purchase it for $0.99.</dd>
            
            <dt>This Stops Map thing sounds cool. What else does it do?</dt>
            <dd>Besides letting you find any bus stop in Santiago on a map, you can also find the nearest Bip! Spot (the place where you can buy or add funds to your Bip! card), search for places or addresses, and enable the functionality to view the route of any service. And it's only $0.99 (USD).</dd>
            
            <dt>Wow.</dt>
            <dd>Yeah.</dd>
            
            <dt>How do I delete one of my favorites?</dt>
            <dd>Tap on the favorite so that the stop results list is visible, then tap the star to remove the stop from Favorites.</dd>
            
            <dt>Can I delete my history?</dt>
            <dd>Absolutely. Just tap and hold on the History button on the tab bar at the bottom and then tap 'Clear All History'.</dd>
