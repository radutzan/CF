            <dt>I reinstalled Cuánto Falta and had previously purchased the Map. How can I get it back?</dt>
            <dd>Your Map purchase is now called 'Cuánto Falta Pro'. Select Restore Purchases in the Store section and it should be restored. If that doesn't work, try pretending to purchase Cuánto Falta Pro and it will activate again <strong>without charging you.</strong></dd>
            
            <dt>The estimations are wrong / There's no information for my stop or service</dt>
            <dd>Sorry to hear that. We recommend <a href="http://twitter.com/transantiago">tweeting @transantiago</a> to let them know you're having problems with their data. You can find out more about who's responsible for delivering the stop estimations in the About screen.</dd>
            
            <dt>Where's the stop code?</dt>
            <dd>The stop code should be on the lower right hand side of the stop sign. If you can't find it or if it isn't there, you can use the Map to find your stop. You can enable it for free with ads or with Cuánto Falta Pro.</dd>
            
            <dt>What's Cuánto Falta Pro?</dt>
            <dd>Cuánto Falta Pro enables the Map, removes all ads from the app and ensures access to Pro features in the future. You can get Pro for $1.99 in the Store section.</dd>
            
            <dt>How do I delete one of my favorites?</dt>
            <dd>Tap on the favorite so that the stop results list is visible, then tap the star to remove the stop from Favorites.</dd>
            
            <dt>Can I delete my history?</dt>
            <dd>Absolutely. Just tap and hold on the History button on the tab bar at the bottom and then tap 'Clear All History'.</dd>
